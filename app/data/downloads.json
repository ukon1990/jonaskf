This can be useful if you are wondering where an item drops etc.</li><li>Added two new filters:<ul><li>Vendor sold items - This list contains all the items that are sold from vendors that are auctionable, and has \"VENDOR\" as sourcetype in blizzards API. Some items might appear in the list that should not, but that is a bug on blizzards end.</li><li>Dropped items - This list contains all the items that can be dropped and are auctionable, and contains \"DROP\" as sourcetype in blizzards API. Some items might appear in the list that should not, but that is a bug on blizzards end.</li></ul></li><li>The filtered table should no longer bug out if a list comes up empty handed. It will no instead have a placeholder item telling you why it might be empty.</li><li>Known bugs:<ul><li>The filtered table should properly add filtered items if the user does not have any WoWuction data available. However, the blizzard auction tab and tooltips won't work.</li><li>If there is WoWuction data available, the fitlered tab won't work, unless you go to \"file -> force refresh filter list\"</li><li>If there are more bugs that I might not be aware of, please post them in the thread @ stormspire (http://stormspire.net/tools-programs-spreadsheets/16083-wow-auction-helper-java-aka-multiplatform.html).</li></ul></li></ul>"

      "summary": "First of all, I'd like to point out that this is a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong><em>game prototype</em></strong></span>. This is a game that I created in the course <em>Introduction to game programming</em> at <a href=\"http://www.hiof.no\" target=\"_blank\">Østfold University College</a>(Opens in a new tab). Please do keep in mind, that I have not created all the textures in the game my self. The textures are bought from <a href=\"http://gametextures.com/\" target=\"_blank\">GameTextures.com</a>. If you have not heard of them, and are in need of some awesome PBR (Physically Based Rendering) materials, check them out! Lots of good materials for games there. Some of the models in this game are from World of Warcraft, but I am under the understanding that it was ok to use it, as long as it was nothing commercial and that it is a \"fan\" game. The original intention was to make everything my self, but as I was alone on this project there simply was not time for it (I also did not have any experience with Maya beforehand). If you wish to get a gimps into the project process, feel free to check out the project page (<a href=\"http://frigg.hiof.no/spillprg_v155/\" target=\"_blank\">http://frigg.hiof.no/spillprg_v155/</a>). You can also find the project report there.",
      "text":"<h3>The game</h3> The game is a 3D sidescroller, where the player collects coins and avoid getting killed by enemies. There is no big plot or storyline behind the game. If you either collect all the coins, win the game by not dying more than 6 times (or 5) or complete the game in less than 6 minutes, you unlock the bonus level.<em>You can see a complete playthrough of the game below. Please keep in mind, that I have edited this video to not show all the times I failed. This makes it seem like objects randomly disappear and my health to go up to 100% out of nowhere.</em><h4>Controls</h4> Keyboard Moving around – WASD keys or Arrow keys Jumping – Space button Interaction – The E button PS4 controller Moving around – Left joystick Jumping – The X button Interaction – The Square button<a href=\"http://jonaskf.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/CollectableTest_unity_-_Rabbit_run_-_PC__Mac___Linux_Standalone__Personal_.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-411\" src=\"http://jonaskf.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/CollectableTest_unity_-_Rabbit_run_-_PC__Mac___Linux_Standalone__Personal_.png\" alt=\"CollectableTest_unity_-_Rabbit_run_-_PC__Mac___Linux_Standalone__Personal_\" width=\"1201\" height=\"315\"/></a><h4>Advancing to the next level</h4> To be able to advance to the next level, you need to find a keycard. This keycard opens some of the doors in the level but not all of them.<h4>How do I unlock the bonus level?</h4> You can unlock the bonus level by collecting all the coins, dying less than 6 times or by completing the whole run form level 1 to 3 in less than 6 minutes.<h4>How to kill enemies</h4> To kill an enemy you simply jump on its head. The Robots and the Monkeys take 1 hit, the turtle takes 2 hits.How to get full healthYou can get back to max health either by dying, or collecting a health potion.<h3>Credits</h3> For the credits list, check out the project document page (<a href=\"http://frigg.hiof.no/spillprg_v155/?page_id=38\" target=\"_blank\">http://frigg.hiof.no/spillprg_v155/?page_id=38</a>).",
